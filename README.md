# Domain 1: Secure Software Concepts:
Steps in Programming:
1. Planning
2. Designing
3. Coding
4. Testing
5. Maintaining

Object-oriented Programming(OOP)
- Encapsulation: Restrict access to internal data
- Modularity: Fixes applied to base classes extend to all derived classes.
- Reusability: Reusing tested Modules reduces risk
- Polymorphism: Ensures controlled behavior in varying scenarios

Object-Oriented Software Development(OOSD)
- Follow the OOP principle, focuse on objects and classes

Component-Based Development(CBD)
- Building systems by integrating pre-existing components
- Modularity
- Reusability
- Interoperability
- Losse Coupling
- Builds on OOP, reuse of larger, pre-built components

Classess, Variables, and Functions

Software Development Lift cycle (SDLC)
- WaterFall Model (Expensive to roll back to previous phase)
  - Static Requirements
- Agile Model
  - Flexibility and Collaboration  
  - scrum
  - Iterative Model (Prototyping)
  - Rapid Applicaiton development - RAD
- Scalad Agile Framework
  - Enterprise-level Agile
- Spiral Model
  - Risk-driven development
- V-Shape Model

COTS and Custom-Developed Software:
- COTS: Ready-made software

Types of Software Licenses:
1. Proprietary: Grants usage but restricts modificaiton and redistribution
2. Open-source
3. Freeware: free for personal use, but restric business purposes
4. Shareware: allow to try before purchase
5. Support License: provides vendor support for troubleshooting and updates
6. Creative Commons
7. Copyleft licenses

Types of Hardware Licenses:
1. OEM
  a. hardware with pre-installed software
2. Site License
  a. unlimited usage within a specific location of facility

Software Asset Management (SAM)
- Cost Efficiency
- Risk Mitigation
- Inventory Control
- Regular internal Audit

SAM Practices:
- track software assets
- manage licenses
- perform internal audit
- retire or reassign software licenses

Imperative Programming: the developer explicitly specifies the steps the computer must take to achieve the desired outcome. It focuses on describing how a program operates.

Declarative Programming: the developer describes what the program should accomplish without explicitly specifying how to achieve it. It focuses on the outcome rather than the process.

Coding tools and Compilers:
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
2. Text Editors
3. Compilers
4. Version Control Systems (VCS)
5. Debugging Tools
6. Build Automation Tools
  a. make
  b. CMake
  c. Maven
7. Testing Frameworks
  a. GTest
8. Package Managers
  - Manage libraries, dependencies
  a. npm
  b. pip
