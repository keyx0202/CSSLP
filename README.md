# Domain 1: Secure Software Concepts:
Steps in Programming:
1. Planning
2. Designing
3. Coding
4. Testing
5. Maintaining

Object-oriented Programming(OOP)
- Encapsulation: Restrict access to internal data
- Modularity: Fixes applied to base classes extend to all derived classes.
- Reusability: Reusing tested Modules reduces risk
- Polymorphism: Ensures controlled behavior in varying scenarios

Object-Oriented Software Development(OOSD)
- Follow the OOP principle, focuse on objects and classes

Component-Based Development(CBD)
- Building systems by integrating pre-existing components
- Modularity
- Reusability
- Interoperability
- Losse Coupling
- Builds on OOP, reuse of larger, pre-built components

Classess, Variables, and Functions

Software Development Lift cycle (SDLC)
- WaterFall Model (Expensive to roll back to previous phase)
  - Static Requirements
- Agile Model
  - Flexibility and Collaboration  
  - scrum
  - Iterative Model (Prototyping)
  - Rapid Applicaiton development - RAD
- Scalad Agile Framework
  - Enterprise-level Agile
- Spiral Model
  - Risk-driven development
- V-Shape Model

COTS and Custom-Developed Software:
- COTS: Ready-made software

Types of Software Licenses:
1. Proprietary: Grants usage but restricts modificaiton and redistribution
2. Open-source
3. Freeware: free for personal use, but restric business purposes
4. Shareware: allow to try before purchase
5. Support License: provides vendor support for troubleshooting and updates
6. Creative Commons
7. Copyleft licenses

Types of Hardware Licenses:
1. OEM
  a. hardware with pre-installed software
2. Site License
  a. unlimited usage within a specific location of facility

Software Asset Management (SAM)
- Cost Efficiency
- Risk Mitigation
- Inventory Control
- Regular internal Audit

SAM Practices:
- track software assets
- manage licenses
- perform internal audit
- retire or reassign software licenses
